Builds the ais binary, ready for inclusion in a docker image. If run as part
of a Jenkins job, this script will go get the current AIS bits from github;
otherwise we work with AIS source bits in your GOPATH.

If the optional "debug" argument is included then we pass gcflags to include
debug info in the binary (to make delve happy).
